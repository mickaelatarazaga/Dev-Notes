## My daily routine

I wake up at 7 am, I bursh my teeth, I prepare breakfast and I sit at the computer to work.   
At 9:30 in the morning we meet with my co-workers for a daily.   
At noon I prepare the food and we had lunch with my boyfriend.  
After continue to work or study until 5 in the afternoon where my working day ends.  
After that time it is my bone time, I go to the gym, I watch a series, I see my family or anything else.  
Night comes, I go to sleep and start again.
